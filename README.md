This project solves the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff (TOV) equations for quark stars, using the 4th-order Runge-Kutta method. 
The project utilizes an equation of state (EOS) for quark stars to compute the mass-radius relationship.

The results are presented in plots, showcasing the correlation between mass and radius for the quark stars.
